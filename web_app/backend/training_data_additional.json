    "question": "如何拍攝飛行中的鳥類？",
    "answer": "Tips for photographing birds in flight:\n\n1. Use fast shutter speed: 1/1000s or faster to freeze motion\n2. Continuous shooting mode: Capture multiple frames per second\n3. Pre-focus on expected flight path: Anticipate where the bird will be\n4. Use telephoto lens: 300mm or longer recommended\n5. Track the bird: Follow with your camera, keep it in frame\n6. Good lighting: Natural light helps with fast shutter speeds\n7. Practice panning: Smooth horizontal or vertical movement\n8. Focus on the eye: Sharp eyes make a great flight photo\n9. Use AI Servo/AF-C mode: Continuous autofocus tracks moving subjects\n10. Be patient: Wait for birds to take off or land for better shots"

    "answer": "Yes, smartphones can take good identification photos! Tips:\n\n• Use good lighting: Natural daylight is best, avoid harsh shadows\n• Get close: Fill the frame with the subject (at least 30% of frame)\n• Focus clearly: Tap on the subject to ensure sharp focus\n• Steady hands: Hold phone steady or use a tripod\n• Multiple angles: Take photos from different sides\n• Use zoom carefully: Digital zoom reduces quality, get physically closer instead\n• Clean lens: Wipe camera lens before shooting\n• Use portrait mode: For better background blur (if available)\n• Avoid flash: Natural light is better for color accuracy\n• Take multiple shots: Best of several photos is better than one\n\nModern smartphones can produce excellent photos for identification!"
